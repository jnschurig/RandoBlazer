Welcome to a randomizer logic simulator. This tool will 
generate a sizeable json object describing locations and 
placements within those locations. This version includes 
items in item checks and souls within lair checks. Eventually 
this will be expanded to include lair monsters and their 
spawn patterns. 

The eventual purpose of this tool and this fork is to 
create a python version of the randomizer with an expandable 
set of features. 

See the [github repo](https://github.com/jnschurig/RandoBlazer/tree/py-conversion) 
for details.

The randomizer code was forked from the [Orphis randomizer](
https://github.com/Orphis/RandoBlazer) which was, in turn, 
forked from [Le Hulk's original](https://github.com/LeHulk1/RandoBlazer).

Rando Blaze it!
